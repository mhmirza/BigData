# BigData

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, Big Data and Large Scale Computing, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/BigData). 

# What I hope to learn?

The goal of this course is to equip students with the understanding, knowledge, and practical skills to develop big data / machine learning solutions with the state-of-the-art tools, particularly those in the Spark environment, with a focus on programming models in MLlib, GraphX, and SparkSQL.

From the course, Decision Analytics for Business & Policy, I wish to learn how to design end-to-end decision analytics pipelines, by: identifying components of decision problems that are (not) susceptible to analytical modeling, and selecting the appropriate tools; translating decision problems to logical, mathematical formulations, and clearly identifying the objectives, decision variables, constraints, input/output; translating these mathematical formulations into code using Gurobi in Python; applying findings back to the decision problem context in business and policy through written and verbal communication.

# Final Project

Brief Description: "To prepare for large public health emergencies, the Allegheny County is prioritizing the list of Points of Dispense (PODs) to open, which are used to distribute essential supplies and medicines to the public during such emergencies. Your goal for this project is to formulate a facility location model, and optimally select a list of PODs from the candidate sites. You need to compare two different formulations: minimizing the total/weighted travel distance of the population, and minimizing the maximum travel distance for anyone."
