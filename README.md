# BigData

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, Big Data and Large Scale Computing, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. To view my GitHub repository, please click [here](https://github.com/mhmirza/BigData). The work done here involves hands-on experience with MapReduce and Apache Spark using real-world datasets. Each of the assignment below encapsulates a thorough grounding in the technologies and best practices used in Big Data Machine Learning.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Big Data & Large Scale Computing, I wish to garner the knowledge and practical skills to develop big data/ machine learning solutions with the state-of-the-art tools, particularly those in the Spark environment, with a focus on programming models in MLlib, GraphX, and SparkSQL.

# Final Project

Brief Description: "To prepare for large public health emergencies, the Allegheny County is prioritizing the list of Points of Dispense (PODs) to open, which are used to distribute essential supplies and medicines to the public during such emergencies. Your goal for this project is to formulate a facility location model, and optimally select a list of PODs from the candidate sites. You need to compare two different formulations: minimizing the total/weighted travel distance of the population, and minimizing the maximum travel distance for anyone."
